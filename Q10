The output of the code will be:

```
1
4
2
3
```

Explanation:

1. `console.log(1);` - This line logs `1` to the console.

2. `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);` - This schedules the execution of the `printNumber` function with the argument `2` after a delay of 0 milliseconds. The `setTimeout` function with a delay of 0 milliseconds is a common way to schedule a function to run as soon as the current call stack is empty. So, it doesn't cause any real delay and executes the function almost immediately after the current code block finishes. Therefore, `printNumber(2)` is executed next, and `2` is logged to the console.

3. `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);` - This schedules the execution of the `printNumber` function with the argument `3` after a delay of 100 milliseconds. This means that the function `printNumber(3)` will be executed after a 100 milliseconds delay. Therefore, it doesn't affect the immediate execution of the following code.

4. `console.log(4);` - This line logs `4` to the console.

The order of execution is as follows:

- The synchronous code is executed first, so `1` is logged to the console.

- The first `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 milliseconds schedules `printNumber(2)` to be executed immediately after the current code block finishes. As a result, `2` is logged to the console.

- The second `setTimeout` with a delay of 100 milliseconds schedules `printNumber(3)` to be executed after a 100 milliseconds delay. Meanwhile, the code continues to execute synchronously.

- Finally, `console.log(4);` is executed, and `4` is logged to the console.

- After 100 milliseconds have passed since the second `setTimeout`, `printNumber(3)` is executed, and `3` is logged to the console.

The output appears in the sequence mentioned above: `1`, `4`, `2`, `3`.
