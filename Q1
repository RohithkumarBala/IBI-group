Cookies, local storage, and session storage are mechanisms used to store data on the client-side (in the user's browser) 
to improve web application performance and user experience. However, they have some key differences in terms of storage capacity,
lifespan, and how they are accessed. Let's explore each one:

1. Cookies:
- Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store on the user's browser.
- They have been around for a long time and are widely used.
- Cookies are sent back and forth between the client and server with each HTTP request and response, adding some overhead to network traffic.
- They have an expiration date or can be set as session cookies that last only until the user closes the browser.
- Cookies are generally limited to storing around 4KB of data.
- They can be accessed both on the client side (JavaScript) and server side (sent along with HTTP requests).
- Cookies are commonly used for storing user preferences, session management, and tracking user behavior.

2. Local Storage:
- Local storage is a newer web storage mechanism that allows websites to store larger amounts of data (usually up to 5-10 MB, depending on the browser).
- Unlike cookies, local storage data is not sent to the server with every HTTP request, reducing the network overhead.
- Local storage data persists even after the user closes the browser and can be accessed as long as the website domain remains the same.
- It is only accessible on the client side (JavaScript) and is not directly accessible by the server.
- Local storage is often used for offline data caching, user settings, and storing non-sensitive data that needs to be available between sessions.

3. Session Storage:
- Session storage is similar to local storage, but it has a shorter lifespan.
- Data stored in session storage is available only for the duration of the browser session. Once the user closes the browser or navigates away from the website, 
the data is cleared.
- Like local storage, session storage is also limited to the client-side (JavaScript) and cannot be accessed directly by the server.
- It is commonly used for temporary data storage during a user's visit, such as holding state information while the user interacts with the website.

In summary, the main differences between cookies, local storage, and session storage are in their capacity, lifespan, network traffic impact, and accessibility.
Developers need to consider these differences when choosing the appropriate storage mechanism for their specific use case.
