Promise chaining is a technique used in JavaScript to sequentially execute asynchronous operations using Promises. It allows you to create a sequence of asynchronous tasks that depend on the results of each other and avoid nesting multiple levels of callbacks, making the code more readable and maintainable.

In Promise chaining, each asynchronous operation returns a Promise, and you can chain `.then()` and `.catch()` methods to handle the resolved or rejected values of those Promises.

Let's illustrate Promise chaining with an example. Suppose we have three asynchronous functions that simulate fetching data from a server with a delay using `setTimeout`. Each function returns a Promise:

```javascript
function fetchDataFromServer1() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data from server 1"), 1000);
  });
}

function fetchDataFromServer2() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data from server 2"), 1500);
  });
}

function fetchDataFromServer3() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data from server 3"), 800);
  });
}
```

Now, we want to fetch data sequentially from these servers and process the results one after the other. We can achieve this using Promise chaining:

```javascript
fetchDataFromServer1()
  .then((data1) => {
    console.log(data1); // Output: "Data from server 1"
    return fetchDataFromServer2();
  })
  .then((data2) => {
    console.log(data2); // Output: "Data from server 2"
    return fetchDataFromServer3();
  })
  .then((data3) => {
    console.log(data3); // Output: "Data from server 3"
    console.log("All data fetched and processed!");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  });
```

Here's what happens in the example:

1. We call `fetchDataFromServer1()`, and once the data is fetched (after 1 second delay), the first `.then()` block executes, and we log the data from server 1.

2. Inside the first `.then()` block, we return the result of `fetchDataFromServer2()`, so the next `.then()` block waits for the Promise returned by `fetchDataFromServer2()` to resolve.

3. The second `.then()` block executes after 1.5 seconds (due to the delay in `fetchDataFromServer2()`), and we log the data from server 2.

4. Inside the second `.then()` block, we return the result of `fetchDataFromServer3()`, so the next `.then()` block waits for the Promise returned by `fetchDataFromServer3()` to resolve.

5. The third `.then()` block executes after 0.8 seconds (due to the delay in `fetchDataFromServer3()`), and we log the data from server 3.

6. Finally, we log "All data fetched and processed!".

If any of the Promises in the chain rejects, the control will jump to the nearest `.catch()` block, allowing you to handle errors gracefully.

Promise chaining simplifies asynchronous control flow and allows you to manage the sequence of operations effectively, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
